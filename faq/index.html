    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <h2>What is tilde.red?</h2>

    <p>tilde.red is a simple, tiny linux machine inspired by Paul Ford’s <a href="http://tilde.club" target="_blank">tilde.club</a>. (You can read more about how all of that happened <a href="https://medium.com/message/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>

    <p>After joining a few clubs, the idea of opening my own came to my mind. After two or three days, tilde.red was accepting registrations.</p>

    <p>It launched at October 25, 2014.</p>

    <p>My name is Berkay Cagir. I can be found on tilde.red at <a href="http://tilde.red/~berkay" target="_blank">tilde.red/~berkay</a></p>

    <p>tilde.red resides on a <a href="http://www.bluevm.com" target="_blank">BlueVM</a> VM.</p>


    <h2>What is tilde.red not?</h2>

    <p>A robust and "unlimited" hosting platform where you should host critical content.</p>


    <h2>Why tilde."red"? That color hurts my eyes!</h2>

    <p>I picked the .red because it was on sale. Joking, I selected .red because almost all the clubs arount were black and I thought that I gotta make a difference. If you don't like the color, you can recommend one at the <a href="https://github.com/tildered/tilde.red/issues/1" target="_blank">Github issue</a>.</p>


    <h2>What can I expect from tilde.red?</h2>

    <p>Backups of the home directories every 6 hours and a notice 15 days before shutdown.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, you should know that this is a very informal project and subject to all sorts of uptime issues, unreliability of service and absence of attention from me.</p>

    <h2>Can I donate a few bucks?</h2>

    <p>If you want to send me some Bitcoins, here you go: <a href="bitcoin:3EHtjxoN7JU9KKKRchVnCtuVzJSyobW3sC">3EHtjxoN7JU9KKKRchVnCtuVzJSyobW3sC</a>. I will put a Paypal donate button soon. Thanks!</p>

    <h2>The server is down! What do I do?</h2>

    <p>Wait. I almost certainly already know about it and am working on it. If you feel you must, you can hit me up on twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/introducial">@introducial</a> (just once is good, thanks).</p>

    <h2>Can you install my favorite software?</h2>

    <p>No.</p>


    <h2>What if I have a problem or something is busted?</h2>

    <p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/tildered/tilde.red/issues" target="_blank">the Github repo</a> and see if the issue already exists. If not, create it.</p>


    <h2>Are there any rules?</h2>

    <p>Yes, <a href="//tilde.red/~faq/rules.html" target="_blank">there are</a>.</p>


    <h2>What can I do with this thing?</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Check out some recently updated pages for inspiration.</li>
       <li>See a list of users who are on the server with command ‘users’</li>
       <li>Talk to other members of tilde.red. You can use mutt to send local systemwide email, talk to chat directly with another member or log into irc using irssi to chat with whoever else is hanging out.</li>
   </ol>

   <h2>How the heck do I use IRC?</h2>

   <p>You type <code>irssi</code> to the command line. Initially, the #tildered channel opens. If it doesn't open, you can open it by typing <code>/join #tildered</code>.</p>


   <h2>How do I log in?</h2>

   <p>Open up a terminal on your computer. Type in <code>ssh your_username@tilde.red</code> and your temporary password (which should have been emailed to you).
    You should change your password right away. Type in passwd, hit enter, and follow the prompts.
    Set up public key authentication, which will soon be required.</p>

    <h2>How do I tweet?</h2>

    <p>You can tweet with the directions below.</p>

    <ul type="1">
       <li>Type <code>tweet</code> and press return.</li>

       <li>Enter the tweet you want and press return.</li>

       <li>Press Ctrl+D to end the process, and Ctrl+L to clean your screen.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>Ta-daa, your tweet's live on <a href="https://twitter.com/tildered" target="_blank">@tildered</a>!</p>
